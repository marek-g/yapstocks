# Yet Another Plasma Stocks Applet

This project is born out of the personal need and interests to monitor stock prices directly from KDE Plasma 5 desktop.

Recommended way to install this is via [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/p/1388640/) (through your desktop's Plasma Add-On Installer).


## Requirements

 - KDE Plasma >= 5.18
 - KDE Frameworks `kirigami2` >= 5.67
 - Qt >= 5.12
 - QtCharts installed


## Known workarounds

If there are duplicated entries on startup, remove duplicated `symbols=` entry in `.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc` file.
